look me dead in my eyes
(Dead in my) 'til the day that I die
(Dead inside) I just wanna feel alive
(With you, I'm alive) with you, I'm alive
Fell in love, but it left me lonely
Tried to trust, but it burned me slowly
I didn't know what I was looking for
'Til I found her
I found her
Without her
I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
'Til I found her (oh, oh)
I've run for many miles trying to find love
From a woman that could love me and never leave my side
And I've run for many miles trying to get away from
The things I'm afraid of and everything inside
You say that we're already done (done)
But what does that even mean?
You tell me to open my eyes
Thank God it was just a dream
I guess that's how you know that it's love
When you're scared to death they'll leave
Just say that you'll never leave, never leave
look me dead in my eyes
(Dead in my) 'til the day that I die
(Dead inside) I just wanna feel alive
(With you, I'm alive) with you, I'm a-, uh
Fell in love, but it left me lonely
Tried to trust, but it burned me slowly
I didn't know what I was looking for
'Til I found her
I found her
Without her
I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
'Til I found her (oh, oh)
'Til we found her
I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
'Til I found her (oh, oh)
'Til I found her
Ooh-ooh-ooh
